Answer for Question 4:


API keys allow for project protection, which is essential for the development of many RESTful APIs. Since APIs allow specific access to their documents and other projects, API keys are necessary to ensure projects are safe from unwanted programs and users. Due to the safety of API keys, the program/project contained in an API is censored from most of the public. This is typically necesarry for limiting site traffic or identifying program patterns.
